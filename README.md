# Simple Keyboard Layout Converter

In development.

**Live preview**: Go to the https://samuelabyan.github.io/keyboard-layout-converter to use the converter.

**How to use**: Begin typing within the text area provided.

**Character conversion**: As you type, the entered characters will be automatically converted to their equivalents based on the predefined mapping. In this example, typing 'a' will display 'ա', 'A' will show 'Ա', '8' will present 'ր', and so forth. (Armenian phonetic layout)

**Use case**: When connecting a physical keyboard to iOS or iPadOS, keyboard layouts are limited. This simple code gives possibility to configure personal layouts. (Typing on your own layouts will only be avaialable on the web.)

Issues:
1. Moving to the next line when pressing Enter does not work.
